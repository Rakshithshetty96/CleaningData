Raw Data

The raw data for this project is accelerometer data collected from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, and was provided to us at the links below:

Data file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zi
This data included both the raw sampled data (folder ../Inertial Signals) and features apparently based on the raw data. For the purpose of this project, I am only looking at the features, not the raw data.

There are 3 types of files:

x: rows of feature measurements
y: the activity labels corresponding to each row of X. Encoded as numbers.
subject: the subjects on which each row of X was measured. Encoded as numbers.
In addition, to determine which features are required, we look at the list of features:

features.txt
The encoding from activity labels ids to descriptive names.

activity_labels.txt
Data load

The Y, S and X data is loaded from each of the training and test datasets, directly as their final type.
Only the columns of interest from X are loaded, that is the mean() and sd() columns. We determine the columns by examining the feature names (from features.txt) for patterns “-mean()” or “-std()”.
All of these files are fixed format text files.

Transformation is mentioned in readme.md file.
